== Scenario

The etcd cluster is encountering some issues with one of the nodes. The logs on etcd1.example.com are showing the following:

[source,bash]
----
etcd1.example.com etcd[1007]: cannot get the version of member b9a10c6a6cd7c960 (Get https://10.0.2.17:2380/version: dial tcp 10.0.2.17:2380: getsockopt: no route to host)
etcd1.example.com etcd[1007]: health check for peer b9a10c6a6cd7c960 could not connect: dial tcp 10.0.2.17:2380: i/o timeout
etcd1.example.com etcd[1007]: failed to reach the peerURL(https://10.0.2.17:2380) of member b9a10c6a6cd7c960 (Get https://10.0.2.17:2380/version: dial tcp 10.0.2.17:2380: i/o timeout)
----

However, the cluster-health check doesn't show any errors:

[source,bash]
----
member 8d21a1be0fb5f806 is healthy: got healthy result from https://10.0.2.15:2379
member 9f5fdf6de278be6c is healthy: got healthy result from https://10.0.2.14:2379
member b9a10c6a6cd7c960 is healthy: got healthy result from https://10.0.2.16:2379
cluster is healthy
----

== Success Criteria

* The cluster can connect with all its nodes backend storage

== What has been done

The reason why the cluster was giving errors was because the `etcd3.example.com` member hat an erronous `peerURLs` set in both `etcd{1,2}.example.com`. +
I noticed the issue by doing: 

[source,bash]
----
# etcdctl -C ${ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS} --ca-file=/etc/etcd/ca.crt --cert-file=/etc/etcd/peer.crt --key-file=/etc/etcd/peer.key member list
2021-06-22 03:22:28.660268 I | warning: ignoring ServerName for user-provided CA for backwards compatibility is deprecated
8d21a1be0fb5f806: name=etcd2.example.com peerURLs=https://10.0.2.15:2380 clientURLs=https://10.0.2.15:2379 isLeader=true
9f5fdf6de278be6c: name=etcd1.example.com peerURLs=https://10.0.2.14:2380 clientURLs=https://10.0.2.14:2379 isLeader=false
b9a10c6a6cd7c960: name=etcd3.example.com peerURLs=https://10.0.2.17:2380 clientURLs=https://10.0.2.16:2379 isLeader=false
----

In order to change it we need to: 

[source,bash]
----
# etcdctl -C ${ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS} --ca-file=/etc/etcd/ca.crt --cert-file=/etc/etcd/peer.crt --key-file=/etc/etcd/peer.key member update b9a10c6a6cd7c960 https://10.0.2.16:2380
2021-06-22 03:23:19.421045 I | warning: ignoring ServerName for user-provided CA for backwards compatibility is deprecated
Updated member with ID b9a10c6a6cd7c960 in cluster
